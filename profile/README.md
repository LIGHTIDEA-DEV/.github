### 👨‍💻 Developers
If you are joining as a developer, start with the **Developer Onboarding & Workflow Guide**:

🔗 https://github.com/LIGHTIDEA-DEV/.github/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPER-ONBOARDING-WORKFLOW.md

This guide explains:
- How to authenticate to organization
- How to clone repositories (HTTPS / SSH)
- How branches work (`dev`, `feature/*`, `main`)
- How to create branches and open Pull Requests
- What is allowed vs blocked (and why)
- What to expect when pushing code or opening PRs

---

### 🛠️ Admins / Tech Leads / DevOps
If you are joining as an admin, maintainer, or DevOps engineer, read the **Golden Repository Baseline Checklist**:

🔗 https://github.com/LIGHTIDEA-DEV/.github/blob/main/docs/ADMINS-REPO-BASELINE-CHECKLIST.md

This checklist defines:
- Required repository settings
- Branch protection rules
- Team permissions
- CODEOWNERS requirements
- Validation steps for new or imported repositories

---

## 🔐 Security Requirement (Mandatory)
All organization members **must enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** on their GitHub account.

🔗 https://github.com/LIGHTIDEA-DEV/.github/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPER-2FA-SETUP.md

Accounts without 2FA may be blocked or removed automatically by GitHub.

---

## 🌿 Branch Strategy
We follow a structured Git workflow:

- `main` – Production-ready code (protected)
- `dev` – Integration branch
- `feature/*` – Feature development
- `hotfix/*` – Emergency production fixes

---

## 🔁 Workflow Rules
- No direct pushes to `main`
- All changes go through Pull Requests
- Code reviews are mandatory
- Ownership is enforced via CODEOWNERS

---
